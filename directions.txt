/*
Write a modularized, menu-driven program to  read a file with unknown number of records.

-Input file has unknown number of records of inventory items, but no more than 100; one record per line in the following  order: 
  -item ID
  -item  name (one word)
  -quantity on hand
  -price 

-All fields in the input file are separated by a tab (‘\t’) or a blank ( up to you)
-No error checking of the data required
-Create a menu which allows to
  print inventory unsorted
  
  search  for an item by ID or name
  
  sort by any field: 
    -item ID
    -item  name (one word)
    -quantity on hand
    -or price. Write one function, that can sort by any field. Do not copy and paste sort code five times into the same function. Tip: use bubble sort. It is easier to modify.
  
  print a report with the following details:
    -number of  unique items in the inventory
    -total worth of the inventory
  -quit the program

-A user  should be able to run many as many times as user wants
-Thoroughly test your program. Your grade partially depends on quality of your test data.
-NO goto, continue, break (except for switch)
-Clearly label the output
-Well document your code (comments)
-Include your test data

Record sample:

997196478 Stroller 25 134.78

TO DO: 
-create menus
-create fake file to read

-create sorting function
-create report function
